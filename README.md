# PagerDuty API Schemas: Github Pages

This branch is source for [Github Pages](https://dobs.github.io/pagerduty-api-schema) associated with the `pagerduty-api-schema` project.

This fork of PagerDuty's `api-schema` project demonstrates how Stoplight Elements can be leveraged standalone as a self-hosted solution for OpenAPI documentation rendering. It includes some very basic custom functionality around:

- Automatically a readonly API token for testing purposes.
- Allowing a custom Github branch via a `branch` parameter.
- Some quasi-responsiveness for smaller browser windows (e.g. mobile).
